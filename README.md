VBScript works very well with C++ either through IDispatch COM objects delivered by CreateObject or via IActiveScript.

Getting started:
 - C:\Windows\System32\cscript.exe
 - C:\Windows\System32\wscript.exe
 - C:\Windows\System32\mshta.exe

Extend your experience by writing COM objects with IDispatch interfaces in:
 - C++
 - C#
 
Build applications with IActiveScript:
 - Implement IActiveScriptSite so you can provide custom UI/UX for error handling
 - Provide an eco system for mixing scripting languages together

Call CoFreeUnusedLibraries often
 - Used this with attach to process for rapid development of new COM objects
